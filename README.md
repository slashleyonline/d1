# CMPM 121 D1 Project

Here's my clicker game project!

The basic theme for this game is summoning people to walk across the screen.
I'm not fully sure why, I just wanted to have a sort of animated component to this game,
and this seemed like it was within scope.

I added a really cool apple background based on pl0the's cool skull background: https://github.com/Pl0the/cmpm-121-f25-d1-autmendo
